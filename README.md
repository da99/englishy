Englishy_Parser
================

A npm module providing simple line and blockquote parsing (w/o paragraphs):

    This is a line.
    This is a 2-line
      line.
    This is a line with a block:
      
      I am a block.
      I am also part of a block.

    # -->
    [ 
      [ "This is a line", nil],
      [ "This is a 2-line line", nil],
      [ "This is a line with a block", "  I am a block.\n  I am also part of a block."]
    ]
